      <h4>The effects of bilateral gains from trade on interstate conflicts</h4>
      <p>
        Do countries that become more dependent upon each other engage in more or less conflict? 
        My study investigates the relationship between trade and conflict taking into account industry-specific 
        trade as well as domestic production networks. I define dependence between countries based on a country’s 
        individual contribution to another country’s real wages which in turn are derived from a multi-industry trade model with input-output linkages. 
        Exploiting exogenous variation in bilateral trade costs based on air and sea distances I find that larger bilateral gains from trade 
        lead to greater political alignment. I furthermore provide evidence that bilateral dependence is associated with fewer bilateral 
        sanctions and fewer interstate military disputes.
