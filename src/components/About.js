        My research interests lie at the intersection of International Trade and Political Economy, primarily concerning the effects of trade on political outcomes.
        I am also interested in the economics of crime, in particular with respect to international drug trafficking.

      In my free time I enjoy exploring the outdoors of British Columbia. I'm a climbing and mountaineering enthusiast and have travelled several places around the world for hiking trips 
      (Canada, Nepal, Thailand, Morocco, Mexico, USA and Brazil among others).
